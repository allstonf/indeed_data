# indeed_data
This is a group project that I worked on for ASA DataFest 2018 at Chapman University. Our project analyzed a one-year job posting dataset from Indeed.com and determined the top three cities within California for a job seeker to move to by ranking the following metrics: Applicant Competition, Job Availability, and Quality of Life and the Job.
