# indeed_data
This is a group project that I worked on for ASA DataFest 2018 at Chapman University. Our project analyzed a one-year job posting dataset from Indeed.com and determined the top three cities within California for a job seeker to move to by ranking the following metrics: Applicant Competition, Job Availability, and Quality of Life and the Job.

___Target Audience:___ Users who encounter limited options within 100 mile radius. 

___Problem:___ Overwhelming options when expanding to State or Country. 

___Goal:___ Simplify the taxing process of preparing to move for work by providing recommended cities based on cost of living in that city, competition, salary, and availability of jobs in userâ€™s category.
